### Assignment 
The goal is to create a client side JavaScript application: “Pokémon Encyclopedia” - Pokédex
( http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex ).
All the necessary Pokémon data is available on http://pokeapi.co/ .


### Features
The application user should be able to:
- See the Pokémon list
- See each Pokémon's details: abilities, moves etc.
- Add Pokémon to the “My Pokémon” list
- Remove Pokémon from the “My Pokémon” list
- See the “My Pokémon” list
- See Pokémon’s details from the “My Pokémon” list

The application should be responsive.
It is ok if the application has additional features, but the minimum list from above should be
implemented.


### UI design
Whatever you choose.


### Technologies
You may choose whatever frontend technologies you want. It’s important that the app works,
that it works from within a browser and that Pokémon can be seen.
